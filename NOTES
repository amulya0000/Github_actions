 1. **What is GitHub Actions?**
    GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that helps you automate your software development workflows, such as building, testing, and deploying your code directly within your GitHub repository.

2. **Why and When you should use GitHub Actions?**
   Use GitHub Actions when you want to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying your code. 
   It helps you save time, maintain consistency, and collaborate more efficiently with your team. 
   You should use GitHub Actions when you want to streamline your development process and focus more on writing code rather than manual tasks.

3. **GitHub Actions vs Jenkins?**
  - GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with GitHub, making it easy to set up and use without any additional infrastructure.
  - Jenkins is a self-hosted automation server that requires more setup and maintenance.
  - GitHub Actions provides better visibility into your workflows directly within your repository.
  - Jenkins has been around longer and has a larger plugin ecosystem for customization.

In simple terms, GitHub Actions is a more modern and integrated solution for automating your workflows within GitHub, 
while Jenkins offers more flexibility and customizability but requires more overhead to set up and maintain.
